Research by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.technavio.com\/\">Technavio<\/a> suggests that the e-learning market will grow to a whopping value of<a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20200615005315\/en\/COVID-19-Impact-and-Recovery-Analysis--Academic-E-Learning-Market-2020-2024-Demand-of-Online-Microlearning-to-Boost-Growth-Technavio\"> $72 billion by 2024<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A popular component of e-learning is the interactive virtual classroom \u2014 web conference calls that allow teachers and students to connect from anywhere in the world via electronic devices. They have been crucial in helping students continue their education while respecting social distance measures to keep them safe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the modern virtual classroom experience is far from frictionless. Many obstacles, such as audio nuisance or network issues, can still get in the way of an engaging experience and prevent students from learning. It\u2019s no wonder <a href=\"https:\/\/tophat.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/TopHat_StudentSurvey_P2.pdf?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTmpFd09EaGhORGt4TVRSaCIsInQiOiJZdERhWm4wRWZYS240RWFCU1B3SHloTEkrUUtcL3laWHRNXC9MYnp3d0dNVEVaTU55dFZVbWI3TURQUEpkdjlCdTg0TTBjTGJSM2RpN1g3SEtSOVFvQVlEWFwvSW10SHdUN2FEaW5SU1JrQXpzWjZUXC96aUFGaisyT003U0JKbDJCbUoifQ%3D%3D\">over 60% of students<\/a> don\u2019t believe that virtual courses are as effective as traditional in-person classrooms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To build the best educational web conferencing platform for students and teachers, you must implement features that optimize student engagement, participation, and communication. That way, student users of your tool can get the most out of their online education.<br><br>Here\u2019s how you can optimize the remote learning experience into your education platform with Dolby.io\u2019s APIs:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-reduce-background-noise-and-unwanted-sounds\"><strong>Reduce Background Noise and Unwanted Sounds<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Students often report having a hard time paying attention in virtual classrooms. According to a survey conducted by<a href=\"https:\/\/ir.mit.edu\/\"> MIT Institutional Research<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/static1.squarespace.com\/static\/5b63672bcef372eea958d8a5\/t\/5ed94dd940762d5e780aca89\/1591299545649\/Remote+Experience+Survey+2020SP+Highlights-PUBLIC.pdf\">79% of students<\/a> say they\u2019re unable to focus as well during online classes as they are in person. One of the reasons for this is <a href=\"https:\/\/dolby.io\/blog\/how-to-remove-background-noise-from-video-and-communicate-better-as-a-team\/\">background noise<\/a> and distracting sounds during the video conferencing call that make them lose focus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s say a teacher is explaining a challenging concept in their online biology class to students, but there\u2019s noise coming from their kids playing and dogs barking in the background that distracts the students. To make up for the sound, they can try to speak louder and repeat themselves, but it could lead to an unpleasant virtual learning experience.<br><br>To prevent background noise from affecting the online classroom, Dolby.io\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/dolby.io\/products\/voice-call\/\">Voice Call<\/a> APIs come with noise suppression technology to eliminate unwanted sounds and maintain a high level of communication. By integrating these features within your platform, you\u2019ll help improve the students\u2019 focus and ensure they can hear every single word from their teacher correctly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the demo video below to get a sneak peek of Dolby.io\u2019s background noise reduction capabilities. It showcases how three people during a web conference call can communicate effectively even with various forms of nuisances in the background:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/dolby.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/image-1024x500-1.png\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RJyVJZv1ZGQ&amp;t=48s\"><em><u>Video Source<\/u><\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-provide-network-resilience-to-students\"><strong>Provide Network Resilience to Students<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another challenge that can get in the way of an engaging virtual classroom training experience is network issues. Over<a href=\"https:\/\/e4e.org\/sites\/default\/files\/voices_from_the_virtual_classroom_2020.pdf\"> 76% of teachers<\/a> believe that lack of access to high-speed internet is an obstacle to effective distance learning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Network issues are a big problem for teachers and students because they create a glitchy online learning experience and cause classes to be canceled, which then need to be rescheduled. As a result, everyone gets behind in the curriculum, which slows down student progress.<br><br>It\u2019s worth noting as well that some students <a href=\"https:\/\/www.edutopia.org\/article\/rural-and-urban-communities-kids-still-cant-get-online\">in lower-income families or underprivileged areas<\/a> may also not have access to a high-quality internet connection, preventing them from learning effectively. It sets them back behind their classmates and creates an unequal virtual classroom environment.<br><br>To manage these challenges, <a href=\"https:\/\/Dolby.io\">Dolby <\/a>has reliable network resilience capabilities to maintain good communication between users, even when the network conditions are not the best. It ensures that the teacher\u2019s class doesn\u2019t take longer than expected because of a poor connection and that a student&#8217;s internet connection doesn\u2019t define the quality of their education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-include-course-recording-and-file-sharing\"><strong>Include Course Recording and File Sharing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Course recording allows teachers to record their virtual classes and share it with learners, so pupils can go back to the session and review anything they didn\u2019t understand the first time. It helps make their studying more effective, review the material at their own pace, and prevents them from getting behind in class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the Dolby.io API suite, you can integrate<a href=\"https:\/\/dolby.io\/products\/call-recording\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> <\/span>Call Recording<\/a> as part of your platform, making it possible to convert virtual classroom sessions into recorded calls that teachers can then share with students. Teachers can also decide to upload their recorded virtual classrooms on video-sharing platforms for others to see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a better learning experience, teachers also need access to file-sharing and screen-sharing features to share important documents with their virtual classrooms. Aside from Call Recording, Dolby.io\u2019s APIs come with screen-sharing and file-presentation capabilities, so teachers can easily share their education materials with students in real-time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-integrate-real-time-chat-messaging\"><strong>Integrate Real-Time Chat Messaging<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the teacher isn\u2019t physically there with students during virtual classrooms, it\u2019s more difficult for pupils to get feedback and ask questions. Chat messaging allows students to ask their teachers questions directly during their online courses and share the answers with others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dolby.io\u2019s APIs include an <a href=\"https:\/\/dolby.io\/products\/messaging\/\">integration<\/a> with chat API company <a href=\"https:\/\/getstream.io\">Stream<\/a> to eliminate the complexity of building an instant-chat messaging feature for your platform. Some of the key chat features that come with the integration are thread replies, message reactions, and real-time notifications, so teachers remain alert each time they get a new message from students.<br><br>As their product was starting to scale, virtual education platform <a href=\"https:\/\/kiddom.co\">Kiddom<\/a>\u2019s priorities were incorporating high-quality audio and video while also adding a live chat feature. The problem, however, was that building these components in-house would have been too challenging and time-consuming for their engineering team.<br><br>While searching for solutions, they first explored Dolby.io\u2019s platform to incorporate better video and audio. From there, the partnership with Stream is what led them to include a real-time, reliable chat messaging feature in their education platform in less than one month. \u201cCommunication is a big area where I think Stream has helped us by allowing us to incorporate chat and announcements,\u201d says <a href=\"https:\/\/getstream.io\/blog\/kiddom-case-study\/\">Jennifer Levanduski<\/a>, head of marketing at Kiddom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of how easy it was to integrate chat with Stream, here\u2019s what the head of product at Kiddom <a href=\"https:\/\/getstream.io\/blog\/kiddom-case-study\/\">Nick Chen <\/a>had to say: \u201cGenerally, the integration went well \u2014 I think it was pretty straightforward. There was a little back and forth between our team and Stream\u2019s team, and the support has gone well.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can learn more about the online learning platform\u2019s success by reading their <a href=\"https:\/\/getstream.io\/blog\/kiddom-case-study\/\">case study<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-deliver-the-best-virtual-classrooms-and-improve-remote-learning-with-dolby-io\"><strong>Deliver the Best Virtual Classrooms and Improve Remote Learning with<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/dolby.io\"><strong> <u>Dolby.io<\/u><\/strong><\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having the right features in your virtual classroom platform allows students and teachers to get the most out of each class.
