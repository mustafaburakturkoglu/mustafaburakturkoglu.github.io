Just ask their devoted and rapidly growing base of content creators, influencers, course creators&#8230;even large corporations. As simple as it is to use, VEED is an incredibly powerful online video editor loaded with features users love, like audio enhancement by Dolby.io. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cWe started looking for a tool that we could plug in to VEED so our users could improve their content with great audio.\u201d<\/p><cite>Sabba Keynejad, VEED\u2019s cofounder and CEO.<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Providing really great audio was an area VEED\u2019s cofounders realized was being completely overlooked by other players in the online video editing space. \u201cSo we started looking for a tool that we could plug in to VEED so our users could improve their content with great audio,\u201d says Sabba Keynejad, VEED\u2019s cofounder and CEO. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCoincidentally, Dolby.io reached out to see if we thought their technology would benefit our users and if we\u2019d be interested in trying it out.\u201d The cofounders jumped at the opportunity and they say it was clear right from the start that the APIs were delivering the benefits their users valued. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-veed-users-enhance-their-audio-in-one-click\">VEED users enhance their audio in one click<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What gets VEED most excited about working with the Dolby.io APIs is the simplicity. Especially since it has always been the company\u2019s goal to offer their users the most simple, easy-to-use platform possible. \u201cNow, with one click, our users can clean their audio and really enhance it, which is something they can&#8217;t do without looking into lots of different platforms and audio analysis,\u201d says Sabba. Speed is also a very big deal for VEED\u2019s users. Sabba says, \u201cBeing able to have a user\u2019s audio processed super-fast and sent back to our platform for them to actually analyze themselves has been really powerful for us.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cHaving really powerful audio cleaning, equalization, and audio enhancement technology is something no one else in their industry is offering, which has really set us apart from the pack.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of VEED\u2019s users aren\u2019t using professional equipment when recording, or even the most up-to-date technology. According to Sabba, \u201cThey&#8217;re just a bit blown away by the actual quality they can get out of something, like, say, a five-year-old iPhone.\u201d Having really powerful audio cleaning, equalization, and audio enhancement technology is something no one else in their industry is offering, which has really set them apart from the pack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dolby.io\u2019s technology has also allowed them to open themselves up to a slightly bigger audience and target more specific categories of users. \u201cSince we\u2019ve had the APIs, we&#8217;ve been able to work our way into the podcasting world\u2014it\u2019s a market we didn&#8217;t know would be relevant to us,\u201d says Sabba. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-media-processing-apis-integrated-into-veed-s-workflow-in-less-than-an-hour\">Media Processing APIs integrated into VEED\u2019s workflow in less than an hour<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Integrating the Dolby.io Media Processing APIs was a relatively simple process for VEED since they were already extracting audio from video for translations and transcriptions. From there, all they had to do was send the file to Dolby, have it cleaned, and wait a short time for the results. In total, the integration took somewhere around 20 minutes to implement. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cIt means we can just get on building a great product, and not have to worry about what&#8217;s actually going on behind the scenes.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Had they not worked with Dolby.io from the start, they say things would have looked a lot different today. \u201cI don&#8217;t think we would have gotten around to adding this sort of functionality for a couple of years,\u201d says Sabba. \u201cIt means we can just get on building a great product, and not have to worry about what&#8217;s actually going on behind the scenes.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The average length of content being processed through the Dolby.io APIs is two-and-a-half minutes, although that can range from hour-long pieces to 15-second Instagram videos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMy advice for other companies looking at Dolby.io would be to just try it and actually test and see if results really work for your use case,\u201d says Sabba. In relation to Dolby.io\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/dolby.io\/pricing\/media-processing\/\">free tier<\/a>, he says, \u201cFor a young startup like ours, in those early days it was just a really smooth introduction to actually get into using the platform.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Dolby.io Case Study: VEED.io\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/S00EPtfSMes?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dolby.io media processing APIs deliver audio enhancement of online user generated content in one click.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":17,"featured_media":2049,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false,"_genesis_hide_title":false,"_genesis_hide_breadcrumbs":false,"_genesis_hide_singular_image":false,"_genesis_hide_footer_widgets":false,"_genesis_custom_body_class":"","_genesis_custom_post_class":"","_genesis_layout":""},"categories":[10,17],"tags":[25,16],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v17.2 (Yoast SEO v18.5.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>How VEED Enabled One-Click Audio Enhancement in 20 Mins<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"VEED is a powerful video editing tool, and with the help of Dolby.io audio, VEED is now a production powerhouse.
