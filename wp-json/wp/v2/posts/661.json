The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCOVID-19 was the defining moment of change, but the clinical environment for surgery has been changing with many surgeons relying on fewer resources and managing more patients,\u201d said Samuel Ethiopia, Co-Founder &amp; Chief Operating Officer at&nbsp;DocSpera.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some surgeons had already adopted third-party telehealth solutions, but jumping between multiple disintegrated systems was not efficient or scalable.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe noticed that the market was shifting toward more telehealth visits, and surgeons were looking for systems that fully integrated into their workflows,\u201d Ethiopia said. \u201cBy including an integrated telehealth experience into&nbsp;DocSpera, we could enable surgeons to have a more productive and less resource-intensive environment.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DocSpera\u2019s&nbsp;R&amp;D team got to work evaluating open source and other third-party video call services, but none offered the right mix of features and affordability.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe main barrier to entry was that they were difficult to implement and there were high startup costs in terms of development time and man-hours,\u201d said Luca&nbsp;Santarella, Head of Research and Development at&nbsp;DocSpera. \u201cWhat we needed was an easy-to-implement solution that was HIPAA compliant, secure, and offered flexible pricing with low upfront costs.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Simplifying Telehealth for Surgeons with Dolby.io&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Realizing the need for a fully managed audio video solution that\u2019s built for healthcare,&nbsp;DocSpera\u2019s&nbsp;R&amp;D team began testing Dolby.io.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDolby.io is a very easy-to-use solution, the Interactivity APIs are easy to use, and the OAuth authentication scheme is familiar to us,\u201d&nbsp;Santarella&nbsp;said. \u201cTheir client SDKs and UI kits were easy to implement and put on our devices\u2014both mobile and web.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within one week, the team had successfully implemented the Dolby.io Interactivity APIs and was ready to pilot test its telehealth solution with surgeons. Almost immediately, praise began to roll in for&nbsp;DocSpera\u2019s&nbsp;new feature.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe telehealth experience that we provided through Dolby.io made it quite seamless for surgeons to easily click on and automate the interaction with their patients,\u201d Ethiopia said. \u201cAnd, they didn\u2019t have to go from one system to another. They were able to capture what they needed in one place, chart the patient, and push it into their electronic medical record right away.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Convenience was not the only benefit of building&nbsp;DocSpera\u2019s&nbsp;telehealth solution with Dolby.io. Surgeons and patients enjoyed high-quality video experiences that enabled natural and lifelike conversations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBecause Dolby.io uses a WebRTC video streaming platform, we noticed very good and very fast video results on mobile clients,\u201d&nbsp;Santarella&nbsp;said. \u201cDolby.io has been a fantastic solution for us, both in terms of security and reliability.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Leveraging Integrated Telehealth as a Market Differentiator&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rapidly developing&nbsp;DocSpera\u2019s&nbsp;telehealth solution with Dolby.io put the company in a position to maximize revenue opportunities with new and existing customers. Some surgeons have already switched to&nbsp;DocSpera\u2019s&nbsp;telehealth solution, and many more plan to do so in the near future.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting quite a great reception from surgeons who are willing to have this as part of their ecosystem,\u201d Ethiopia said. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite easy to deploy, and it\u2019s quite easy to get our surgeons interested in this.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Onboarding users to the new feature is also easy\u2014both for surgeons and the team at&nbsp;DocSpera.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSurgeons really want something that is seamless and interoperable, which has always been one of our key principles in delivering products,\u201d Ethiopia said. \u201cThe fact that people can just activate this feature automatically without needing to download software has made the rollout quite easy.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DocSpera\u2019s&nbsp;telehealth solution, powered by Dolby.io, also provides a competitive advantage in an increasingly crowded&nbsp;healthtech&nbsp;industry.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe need solutions like Dolby.io to help us move to the next level,\u201d Ethiopia said. \u201cThe telehealth solution allows us to become more virtual and support surgeons from any location, so they\u2019re able to provide the best services possible for their patients.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Build Your Telehealth Solution with Dolby.io&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Need a complete, scalable audio video solution with HIPPA-compliant Interactivity APIs?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn why modern&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/dolby.io\/solutions\/healthcare?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_campaign=docspera_case_study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">health technology companies<\/a>&nbsp;trust Dolby.io Interactivity APIs.
