However, with so many aspects to choose from, how do you decide which features to prioritize? <br><br>If your product relies on audiovisual media, poor-quality audio will ruin user engagement more than anything &#8211; regardless of how many other fancy features it may have. Therefore, it\u2019s essential to prioritize audio enhancement in your product roadmap since it impacts the user experience and customer retention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-why-audio-needs-to-be-a-priority-in-your-product-roadmap\"><strong>Why Audio Needs to Be a Priority in Your Product Roadmap<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not easy for product managers to find the best features to focus on in your product. They\u2019re under pressure from many different stakeholders, all with different priorities to add as many upgrades as possible. Here\u2019s why audio needs to be at the top of your product roadmap\u2019s list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-improves-the-user-experience-and-drives-engagement\"><strong>Improves the User Experience and Drives Engagement<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Audio quality has a significant influence on the user\u2019s experience with your product. For example, let\u2019s say a user has a conference call, but they\u2019re having video problems in the process. Even if the video quality becomes glitchy, as long as the audio is top-notch, they\u2019ll still be able to use the platform to communicate effectively. <br><br>Optimizing your product\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/dolby.io\/blog\/why-audio-experience-matters-for-video-conferencing-tools\/?&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=mediacomms-blog&amp;utm_source=blog\">audio experience<\/a> in the product roadmap gets you closer to re-creating an in-person human interaction. It will help build a connection with your customers and make their experience more realistic. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-influences-credibility-and-trust\"><strong>Influences Credibility and Trust<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What matters isn\u2019t just what is said \u2014 it\u2019s also how it\u2019s delivered. Besides providing a better user experience, audio has a significant influence on whether we trust the information we\u2019re receiving.<br><br><a href=\"https:\/\/news.usc.edu\/141042\/why-we-believe-something-audio-sound-quality\/\">A study<\/a> by the University of Southern California and the Australian National University highlighted the negative impact on trust that comes with poor-quality audio. They tested two YouTube conference videos on the subject of physics: one with high-quality audio and the other with poor-quality audio. Each research participant received just one of these two calls, then was asked to rate the conference they were viewing.<br><br>The researchers found out that participants viewed the speaker as less intelligent in the talk with low-quality audio and considered their research less credible, even though they covered the same topic. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-gives-you-a-competitive-advantage\"><strong>Gives You a Competitive Advantage<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To create the best product, you\u2019ll need to find ways to stand out from the competition. Otherwise, why should your audience choose your product over others in your industry?<br><br>An excellent audio experience can become your unique selling point for customers. Considering that it\u2019s often overlooked by companies, it\u2019s a good way to get the customer\u2019s attention and retain them on your platform. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-different-industries-can-benefit-from-high-quality-audio\"><strong>How Different Industries Can Benefit from High-Quality Audio<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each company has different needs based on their industry, but all have something to gain from enhancing the audio experience. Here\u2019s how focusing on audio in the product roadmap can resolve some of the most common issues that companies across different niches face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-telehealth-clarifies-patients-diagnoses\"><strong>Telehealth: Clarifies Patients\u2019 Diagnoses<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Telehealth consists of distributing healthcare services via online communication (such as video conferencing). It offers the opportunity to provide healthcare access to patients from anywhere in the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-the-problem\"><strong>The Problem:<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Doctors need to have deep conversations with their patients to get accurate diagnoses. However, poor-quality audio can make it challenging to have a productive discussion or identify disease symptoms (coughing, sneezing, etc.).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is that patients may not get the necessary treatment they need, which can be dangerous for the patient and hurt the health provider\u2019s reputation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-the-solution\"><strong>The Solution:<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Exceptional audio allows doctors to hear every single detail that matters in their conversations with patients. That way, they can deliver the correct diagnosis and identify which steps to take in order to solve patients\u2019 issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-education-keeps-students-engaged-and-eliminates-distractions\"><strong>Education: Keeps Students Engaged and Eliminates Distractions<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the start of the pandemic, remote learning has seen a dramatic boost and has become an effective way to adapt to difficult circumstances: the market expects to grow by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20200615005315\/en\/COVID-19-Impact-and-Recovery-Analysis--Academic-E-Learning-Market-2020-2024-Demand-of-Online-Microlearning-to-Boost-Growth-Technavio\">$72 billion by 2024<\/a>. It helps students maintain their education while still respecting social distancing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-the-problem-1\"><strong>The Problem:<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A common challenge among education professionals is keeping students engaged during virtual classes. Many students complain that virtual classrooms don\u2019t feel like the real thing.<br><br>Distractions during calls can become an obstacle to productive learning. If disruptions, such as background noise, frequently pop up in a teacher\u2019s virtual class, students won\u2019t stay focused long or retain the information.<br><br>Aside from virtual classes, any audio disruption that arises in pre-recorded class content will also negatively impact your students&#8217; learning. Students will have to go back and forth between each point the teacher makes throughout the lecture in the video to try to understand what they said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-the-solution-1\"><strong>The Solution:<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimizing the audio experience can help re-create a lifelike experience for your class that keeps remote students engaged, even if you\u2019re thousands of miles away. Making audio enhancement a priority also allows you to drastically reduce background noise and any other distractions that get in the way of learning. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-customer-and-field-service-solves-customer-requests-faster-and-more-efficiently\"><strong>Customer and Field Service: Solves Customer Requests Faster and More Efficiently<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Customer service is part and parcel of running a business and can significantly impact your brand reputation. <a href=\"https:\/\/clouddamcdnprodep.azureedge.net\/gdc\/gdcPiLLQw\/original?ocid=mkto_eml_EM582302A1LA1\">Ninety percent of  consumers<\/a> consider customer service a vital factor in whether they\u2019ll do business with a company:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-the-problem-2\"><strong>The Problem:<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Poor audio during customer service calls can make your business look unprofessional and make customers act angry. It\u2019s not only going to create an unpleasant experience for your support team, but your brand reputation will take a hit as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-the-solution-2\"><strong>The Solution:<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>High-quality audio ensures that you hear every word your customers say and have a clear conversation, so you can quickly solve their requests. Your customer service and brand loyalty will improve as a result. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-podcasting\"><strong>Podcasting<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to an article by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/bradadgate\/2021\/02\/11\/podcasting-has-become-a-big-business\/?sh=711b4db72cfb\">Forbes<\/a>, more and more people are tuning in to podcasts: 125 million people worldwide will listen to a podcast each month by 2022, which represents a 25% growth from 2020. The reason behind this success is because podcasts make it easy to learn and absorb information while doing daily activities such as exercising or doing home chores.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-the-problem-3\"><strong>The Problem:<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s nothing more annoying than recording what you thought was the perfect podcast episode, only to realize it\u2019s full of audio issues and disruptions. Users will then have to go back and forth in the track to eliminate background noise and annoying sounds such as plosives or sibilance. It\u2019s a significantly time-consuming process, especially if they don\u2019t have an audio engineering background.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-the-solution-3\"><strong>The Solution:<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding an audio enhancer feature to your product will make life easier so much easier for your users. Within just one click, they\u2019ll be able to make their podcast episode\u2019s audio clearer and clean up any issues without the need of an engineering team. It\u2019s going to save them so much time and headaches in advance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-web-conferencing-allows-participants-to-understand-everything-in-their-calls\">Web-Conferencing: Allows Participants To Understand Everything In Their Calls<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Web conferencing platforms offer many benefits to business professionals. For example, it reduces the need to travel, allows communication with employees or customers worldwide, and provides a more flexible way to arrange meetings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-the-problem-4\"><strong>The Problem:<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Users of web conference meetings solutions often complain about not hearing and understanding everything said during their calls. It\u2019s a significant source of friction when important information is discussed, but participants are missing half of the details.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-the-solution-4\"><strong>The Solution:<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>High-quality audio ensures that participants can hear everything they need to hear during their conference calls, instead of having to repeat to others what they said during the discussion. In other words, it helps users stay \u201cin\u201d the meeting and not \u201chalf in it.\u201d As a result, participants gain the peace of mind that they didn\u2019t miss anything vital and will have more productive meetings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-best-practices-for-building-your-audio-roadmap\"><strong>Best Practices for Building Your Audio Roadmap<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a couple of things to consider as you prioritize audio in your product roadmap.

Your product vision could be to offer the best, most convenient healthcare to patients. Optimizing audio could improve the provider and patient relationship by delivering more human-like conversations. It also enables access to those who cannot regularly visit an office in person (especially if out of network).<br><br>Or, if you\u2019re a live gaming streaming company, maybe your goal is to create an exceptional, immersive experience for gamers. Just like in cinema, maximizing audio will help drive emotion in gaming and pull your audience into the game\u2019s world. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-align-with-stakeholders\"><strong>Align with Stakeholders<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, you\u2019ll have to set up a meeting with stakeholders and explain the reasoning behind the decision to focus on audio.

You\u2019ll also need to structure how you\u2019ll launch the new feature and promote it to customers.<br><br>For example, your sales team is in charge of closing new deals and converting prospects. Think about how you\u2019ll be explaining the benefits of your new audio feature to them, so they use it in their next pitch to potential customers.<br><br>You\u2019ll also need to set up critical dates for the launch and meet with your marketing department to strategize how you\u2019ll be promoting the release of your new enhanced audio feature. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-examples-of-companies-maximizing-audio-to-engage-users\"><strong>Examples of Companies Maximizing Audio to Engage Users<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So what does optimizing your audio in your product roadmap look like in the real world?
