Without limiting the foregoing, Customer shall not, and shall ensure that its authorized users do not, use the Services (i) to perform any activity that is unlawful, or that is harmful to or interferes with any use of the Services, or the network, systems, or facilities used to provide the Services; (ii) in violation of any third party\u2019s privacy, intellectual property, or other rights; (iii) to perform any activity intended to circumvent the security measures of Dolby or any third party. Further, Customer shall not, and shall ensure that its authorized users do not, (i) modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any portion of the Services, (ii) use any robot, spider, site search\/retrieval application, or other manual or automatic device to retrieve, index, \u201cscrape,\u201d \u201cdata mine,\u201d or in any way reproduce or circumvent the navigational structure or presentation of the Services, or (iii) use the Services as the basis for developing a competitive solution (or contract with a third-party to do so), or allow third-parties to use or exploit the Services separate from your product(s) or services without Dolby\u2019s express written consent. If Customer becomes aware of any breach of the foregoing, Customer will immediately notify Dolby by email to <a href=\"mailto:support@dolby.io\">support@dolby.io<\/a> and remedy the situation, including, if necessary, by limiting, suspending, or terminating any relevant user\u2019s access to the Services. Dolby may in its sole discretion make some or all Services available to Customer on a trial basis, free of charge or at a promotional rate, until the end of the trial period (\u201cPromotional Offer\u201d). Unless a Promotional Offer is advertised as available to past or current Customers to the Services, Promotional Offers are only available to new customers. Customer may not create duplicate Customer accounts in an attempt to circumvent paying any fees due and payable for Customer\u2019s continued Access to the Services. Dolby reserves the right to suspend Customer\u2019s access to the Services if reasonably necessary to prevent harm to anyone, with such notice as may be reasonable in the context of the prospective harm. Customer is responsible for the confidentiality and use of all credentials issued to Customer or its personnel to access the Services, and for all use of the Services facilitated by such credentials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-c-modification\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dolby.io\/#c-modification\"><\/a><em>C. Modification.<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Services include all updates to the Services made generally available by Dolby without additional charge. Dolby may charge additional fees for new products, features, and services, and Customer may choose whether or not to purchase them at Customer\u2019s sole discretion. Dolby may modify or remove the Services (including without limitation by changing the user interface of the Services or removing certain features of the Services) from time to time without prior notice to Customer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-d-additional-terms\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dolby.io\/#d-additional-terms\"><\/a><em>D.

Fees\/Payment\/Taxes.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Access to the Services, or to certain features of the Services, may require Customer to pay fees as set forth on Dolby\u2019s website. Before Customer becomes obligated to pay any fees, Customer will have an opportunity to review the basis for calculating such fees and access or use of the Services constitutes acceptance of the fees that will be charged. All fees are non-refundable, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. If Dolby changes the fees for the Services, including by adding additional fees or charges, Dolby will provide Customer advance notice of those changes. Customer\u2019s continued access or use of the Services after Dolby implements the fee changes constitutes acceptance of those fee changes; if Customer does not accept the fee changes, Customer must discontinue use of the Services before Dolby implements the fee changes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Customer has entered into a separate written agreement with Dolby governing Customer\u2019s use of the Services which specifies the fees for the Services, such fees will remain as provided therein for the term of that agreement. Dolby or its payment processor will charge the payment method specified by Customer through the Services. Customer authorizes Dolby or its payment processor to charge all sums as described in these Terms, for the Services Customer selects, to that payment method. If Customer pays any fees with a credit card, Dolby or its payment processor may seek pre-authorization of Customer\u2019s credit card account prior to Customer\u2019s purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover such purchase. The Services may include functionality for activating, updating or canceling recurring payments for periodic charges. If Customer activates or updates recurring payments through the Services, Customer authorizes Dolby or its payment processor to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or Customer\u2019s account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. If Customer uses the Services to update or cancel any existing authorized one-time or recurring payment, it may take several business days for the update or cancellation to take effect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-3-term-and-termination\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dolby.io\/#3-term-and-termination\"><\/a>3.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if there is an order form(s) in effect, then these Terms will not terminate until such order form(s) have expired or been terminated. If Customer violates any provision of these Terms or if Customer uses the Services in violation of any applicable law or regulation (\u201c<strong>Applicable Law<\/strong>\u201d), Customer\u2019s permission from us to use the Services will terminate automatically. In addition, Dolby may in its sole discretion terminate Customer\u2019s user account or suspend or terminate Customer\u2019s access to the Services at any time if Customer violates any provision of these Terms, if we no longer provide any part of the Services, or for any reason or no reason, with or without notice. We also reserve the right to modify or discontinue the Services at any time (including by limiting or discontinuing certain features of the Services), temporarily or permanently, without notice to Customer and without liability. To the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law, we will have no liability whatsoever on account of any change to the Services or any suspension or termination of Customer\u2019s access to or use of the Services. Upon the termination of Customer\u2019s account or the Terms for any reason, Dolby may at its option delete any data associated with Customer\u2019s account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-c-effect-of-termination\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dolby.io\/#c-effect-of-termination\"><\/a><em>C.

Regardless of how the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written description that explains the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award are based. The arbitrator may award the same damages to Customer individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to Customer individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy Customer\u2019s individual claim. The parties must not disclose the amount of any settlement offer made by Customer or Dolby to the arbitrator during the arbitration, until the arbitrator has made a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator finds in Customer\u2019s favor, Dolby will pay Customer the highest of: (a) the amount the arbitrator awards Customer, if any; (b) the last written settlement amount Dolby regarding the Dispute before the arbitrator\u2019s final decision and award; or (c) $1,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-h-arbitration-fees\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dolby.io\/#h-arbitration-fees\"><\/a><em>H.

If Customer\u2019s claim is for more than $10,000, the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. At any time during the arbitration, the arbitrator may make rulings and resolve any disputes about the payment or reimbursement of fees or expenses; either party may also request a ruling on these issues within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits. If the arbitrator finds that the substance of Customer\u2019s claim or Customer\u2019s request for relief is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
